# Spam Detection Project

This project is a simple implementation of a spam detection system using machine learning. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models and evaluation metrics.

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the preprocessing script to clean and vectorize data.
- Train the model using the training script.
- Evaluate the model and check performance metrics.
